NSFPlay/NSFPlug source code

This code is maintained by Brad Smith. It is a fork of NSFPlay/NSFPlug by Brezza. The latest version should be available at:
- https://bbbradsmith.github.io/nsfplay/

Unstable preview builds will be automatically generated by Appveyor:
- https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bbbradsmith/nsfplay/branch/master/artifacts

This code contains several modifications to original, see nsfplay.txt for a list of changes.

I have presumed based on text comments and readme files in the original code that it is distributed freely, and modification and redistribution is permitted. The same permissive license applies to this version of the code I maintain. You may reuse this code without restriction, and no warranty or liability is implied on my part.

Feel free to contact me with questions or comments.
