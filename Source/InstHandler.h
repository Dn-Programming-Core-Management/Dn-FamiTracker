	associated channel via the assigned channel interface. Its exact type is determined by the
	channel handler when creating a new handler for the currently played instrument; exactly one
	subclass must exist for each instrument type. In absence of an instrument handler, a channel
	receives no changes to its sound state from the current instrument.
