	Previously the audio thread would call AfxMessageBox upon errors. The resulting
	message boxes would often appear under the main window.

	https://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?454091-AfxMessageBox-from-a-worker-thread
	says to never call AfxMessageBox from a non-GUI thread, but instead call PostMessage
	to an object on the main window. http://flounder.com/workerthreads.htm says it can
	be a view rather than a CWinApp.

	As a result, the audio thread now calls
	CFamiTrackerView::PostMessage(WM_USER_ERROR, nIDPrompt, nType), which messages the
	main thread to call CFamiTrackerView::OnAudioThreadError(), which calls
	AfxMessageBox(nIDPrompt, nType).
