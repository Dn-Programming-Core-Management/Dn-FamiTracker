The original FT NSF driver's source code is explicitly *not* under the
GPL.[^1][^2][^3]

It is instead source-available, under no explicit license. Based on its usecase,
and jsr's comments [^4], I presume that distribution and modification is
permitted, and attribution is recommended.

0CC-FamiTracker's NSF driver code modifications is licensed under GPL v2,
which may restrict anyone sharing compiled NSFs and binaries without sharing the
assembly source, as they contain machine code that directly correlates to the
NSF driver source.

0CC-FT NSF driver modifications are under GPL v2.

Dn-FT NSF driver modifications are under the same license as 0CC-FT NSF driver
modifications.
