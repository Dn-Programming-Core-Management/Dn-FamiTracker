Version 0.6.3 - August 1 2020

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.6.3 - 08/01/20

This will be the final release. This program has been effectively dead for
months to years, as my priorities have moved elsewhere, to building a new
tracker from scratch, freed from MFC and being chained to Win32, freed from
DirectSound and 40-70 ms of audio latency, freed from a fixed row grid that
falls apart as soon as you try to use triplets...

Additionally I can't let this program continue under its current name. I can't
have people talking to me about the program under its current name. I should've
renamed the program earlier, but never picked one.

As a parting gift, I've attached a 64-bit build from CMake as well. This may be
compatible with Wine on macOS Catalina (though you'll have to either build Wine
yourself or look for prebuilt packages, maybe
https://www.reddit.com/r/wine_gaming/comments/er28u5/is_there_anyway_to_run_wine_in_macos_catalina/ff14rns/ ).

I invite the community to fork the program, possibly under a name like
FamiTracker-Next. I may participate if I regain interest.

 - Fix 5B instrument recording (#138, @Teuthida255)
 - Re-add ability to disable "retrieve channel state" (#146)
 - Remove popup message box when enabling linear pitch mode (#144)

    0x80 (#165)



j0.6.2 - 06/16/19

the version number in the .exe is wrong. Ignore it.

 - Update VRC7 preset patches (#135) (by @Teuthida255)
 - Fix crash when pasting large selections near the rightmost channel (#137)
See https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nyanpasu64/0cc-famitracker/history for dev

j0.6.0a - 07/08/18

j0.6.0a is identical to j0.6.0, except with correct .exe version number, and
.pdb debug info available in release builds, to help debug crash dumps.

Changelog:

 - Add =00 effect (VRC6 phase reset) (no effect on NSF)
 - Add configurable font size scaling (without changing row height)
 - Always enable Retrieve Channel State (remove config option)
 - Every time you begin playback, j0CC loads the current volume and active
    effects.
 - Validate Vxx and DPCM (Zxx) effects, mark out-of-bounds parameters as red
 - eg. V04 and above in 2A03, Z80 and above in DPCM
 - Add confirmation dialog when clearing recent files
 - Interface text improvements to improve information and clarity

Bugfixes:

 - Fixed 5B noise bug where non-noise instruments overwrite noise period (0CC
    playback)
 - Fixed 5B noise-period envelopes when exporting NSF files
 - Note: 5B Wxx effect (noise period) has no effect in NSF
 - Fix theme color importing bug, where "Highlighted background 2" would
    overwrite "Highlighted background" (also "Highlighted pattern text 2")
 - Fix crash when cancelling "export to WAV" dialog

Internal:

 - Now generates .pdb debug info for release builds, to help debug crash dumps.
 - CLion (CMake) build support
 - Move NSF driver source into this repository, add build script
 - To reduce repository clutter, move resource.h and 0CC-FamiTracker.rc to res/



j0.5.3 - 06/01/18

Changelog:

 - Improved descriptions for 1xx and 2xx effects.

Bugfixes:

 - Fix bug where Xxx effect (DPCM retrigger) waited xx frames for first
    retrigger, subsequently xx+1 frames.
 - Still broken in NSF export
 - Center N163 output about sample=8, when volumes change (hardware-accurate).
 - Previously centered about sample=0, creating loud pops when changing volume)
 - Fixed bug where VRC7 Ixx (custom instrument) effect didn't work, when Channel
    1 contains default instruments.
 - Not broken in NSF export
 - Fixed bug where N163 Zxx (wave position) effects would fail when switching
    instruments. (Removed Zxx error checking, since it checked the old wave
	size)
 - Fixed bug where "Ignore Step when moving" wouldn't take effect until changing
    step size.



j0.0.5.2 - 04/29/18

Changelog:

 - FTM, NSF, and text exports share "most recent path".

Bugfixes:

 - Reset N163 level offset in sound engine, when switching files.

 - Enable through the Module Properties dialog (Ctrl+P).
 - Typing Pxx (or FDS Zxx) defaults to P80.

    version number.
 - Fixed #10 and #11 for Wine users.


j0.0.2 - 03/02/18

 - Fixed a crashing issue in debug builds, and reported to occur in release
    builds. (Caused by hires FFT)



j0.0.1 - 03/02/18

Bugfixes:

 - Don't corrupt memory when entering MML volume sequences over 252 items long
    (instead truncate).
 - Fix bug where find-replacing anything with an empty effect creates " 00"
    effect.
 - Fix text import instrument loop/release (@owomomo, fixed in 0.3.15.1).
 - Update channel count after importing text (like master). Mark file as
    modified.
	
Enhancements:

 - N163 wave editor's copy/paste buttons copy all waves at once,
    separated/terminated with semicolons. This allows for highly efficient
	Audacity-N163 import workflows(see
	https://gist.github.com/nyanpasu64/424110eab84dad50cf1a6646a72b2627).
 - Hi-res FFT spectrogram (like master).



n163-2018-02-10 - 02/12/18

My changes:
 - Fixed importing FTI instruments containing DPCM samples where length's
    bytes >= 0x80. This fixes Extends Levant bass.
 - Fix memory corruption when entering MML volume sequences over 252 items long.
 - Modify N163 dialog buttons to copy/paste all waveforms at once, separated by
     semicolons. A very useful import format for Audacity wavetable exporting,
	 and copy-pasting between instruments.

Bugfixes from HertzDevil:
 - Changing channels does not clear bookmarks.
 - Changing grooves does not crash (I think).
 - RAM usage decreased for large files.

Known bugs:
 - Oscilloscope is partially flatlined.
 - Setting engine speeds <= 24 Hz causes memory corruption and crashes.
    (long-standing bug)
 - Clearing File/Recent Files results in memory corruption, crashing, and system
    freezes.
