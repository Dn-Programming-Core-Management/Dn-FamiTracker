    <p class="text">
        This is the sound generator found inside the NES CPU. The NTSC version 
        (america/japan) is named 2A03 and the PAL version (europe) is named 2A07. The 
        difference between the chips is that NTSC version runs at 1.79 MHz and 60 FPS 
        while PAL runs at 1.66 MHz and 50 FPS.</p>
    <p class="text">
        The audio refresh rate is normally tied to the video refresh rate, where each 
        video frame corresponds to one audio tick, but the NSF format allows any refresh 
        rate and is customizable from the 
        <a href="menu_tracker.htm">Tracker menu</a></p>
    <p class="text">
        There is five sound channels available:</p>
    
    <ul class="text">
        <li><b>Pulse 1 and 2</b><br />
            Produces pulse waves with four duty lengths (12.5%, 25%, 50% and 25% inverted). 
            These channels have a hardware sweep unit that can be accessed by
            <a href="effect_list.htm">H and I effects</a>.<br /><br />
            <i>Note:</i> There is a bug that resets the duty phase when switching between 
            certain frequencies, this can be heard as a pop and might be noticable when 
            using vibrato or pitch slides across those frequencies.<br /><br />
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Triangle</b><br />
            Triangle shaped waveform. There is no volume control for this channel, 
            so it will always be either on or off. The triangle cycle period is 
            twice as long as for square channels so triangle notes will be one octave lower than 
            square notes.<br /><br />
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Noise</b><br />
            White noise generator.<br />
                        Can produce 32k-bit and 93-bit sequences, selectable
            from the instruments duty/noise setting. There are only 16 different 
            pitches available, so a pitch value instead of notes &amp; octaves is displayed.<br /><br />
        </li>

        <li><b>DPCM (Delta PCM)</b><br />
            Also known as DMC.<br />
            Used to play delta modulated samples. 
            Channel effects (volume, arpeggio &amp; pitch slides) does not work on this channel. 
            The volume column has no effect on this channel.
        </li>
    </ul>

                    <b>Note:</b> 
                    The volume level 
                    of triangle and noise channels will be affected by the DPCM channel, 
                    due to the way the sound is mixed in the hardware.

        The 2A03 instruments contains a combination of parameters for the 
        waveform channels and a set of samples for the DPCM channel.</p>

    <p class="text">
        This part of the instrument is only used by the wave channels of 2A03 (pulse, triangle and noise). 
        The idea is based on the MML style, where a set of sequences are used to program the channels. 
        A sequence is a list of values that are applied to the channel at the same rate as the NSF refresh rate, shown in the main window.
        As shown in the example above, 30 steps take 500 ms to run when using the default rate of 60 FPS.</p>
    
    <p class="text">
        These effects are available</p>
    
    <ul class="text">
        <li>
            <b>Volume</b><br />
            Controls channel amplitude. The triangle channel has no volume control, but a volume of zero will make it silent.<br />
            Range: <b>0</b> to <b>15</b>.<br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Arpeggio</b><br />
            Used for rapid note shifting, commonly used to simulate chords. This sequence has three separate modes: absolute, relative and fixed.<br />
            <ul>
            <li><i>Absolute:</i></li> adds to the base note (default).<br />
            <li><i>Relative:</i></li> adds to the base note and saves the result as new base note.<br />
            <li><i>Fixed:</i></li> does not add to the base note, instead it's used after the sequence 
            is done. Adding a loop prevents the base note from being used at all.<br />
            </ul>
            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Pitch bend / high-speed pitch bend</b><br />
            Affects the pitch, Hi-pitch multiplies the value by 16.<br />
            Range: <b>-127</b> to <b>126</b> (pitch units)<br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Duty cycle / noise mode</b><br />
            Sets the duty cycle period and noise mode, the triangle channel is unaffected.<br />
            <ul>
            <li><i>Pulse:</i></li> <b>0</b> = 12.5%, <b>1</b> = 25%, <b>2</b> = 50%, <b>3</b> = 75% (pulse width)<br />
