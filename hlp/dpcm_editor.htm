    <span class="topic">DPCM sample editor</span>
    <hr />

    <p class="text">There is a simple DPCM sample editor available from
        the <a href="2a03.htm#Instruments">DPCM instrument editor</a>,
        it&#39;s intended mainly for trimming silent parts from the beginning and end of samples.
        Other types of edits should be done preferably before the sample is
        converted to DPCM.</p>

    <p class="text">Use the sample area to select a part of the sample and to set the
        start position (for preview).</p>

    <ul class="text">
        <li><b>Play</b><br />
            Previews the sample at the selected pitch.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Delete</b><br />
            Removes a part of the sample, select the part you wish to remove and press delete. This works best on the
            beginning and end of a sample; if you need to remove something in the middle
            then it&#39;s usually better to do this on the sample before you convert it to DPCM.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Tilt</b><br />
            Inserts zero-value samples
            inside a selected area, causing the sample to tilt toward zero. The idea is to
            restore the delta counter back to zero when the sample
            has finished, in order to restore volume for the triangle and noise channels.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Bit Reverse</b><br />
            Reverses the bit sequence of each byte in the DPCM sample. Useful for restoring bit-reversed
            samples, or creating new timbres for new ones.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Center wave</b><br />
            Draws the sample with an initial delta counter value of 64 in order to center the start of the wave.
            This is another method to keep the triangle and noise volume consistent, make
            sure all samples starts and ends at 64.
            The sample itself is not affected by this option, the equal operation in the
            tracker is to use the effect <a href="effect_list.htm">Z40</a> when playing the sample.
            <br />
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">
        The offset value tells the start position (as used internally by
        the DPCM channel), this value can be used with the
        <a href="effect_list.htm">Yxx command</a>.
        The pos value is the position in size units as used by the DPCM channel.</p>
