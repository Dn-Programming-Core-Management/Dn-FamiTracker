    <p class="heading">About</p>

    <p class="text">
        The VRC6 chip has two square wave channels and one sawtooth wave
        channel. This chip was used in games as Akumajou Densetsu and Madara by
        Konami.</p>

    <p class="text"><b>Pulse 1 and 2</b></p>

    <p class="text">
        Produces pulse waves like the internal channels, but have eight different duty
        settings and lacks hardware sweep. They can also go deeper in frequency.</p>

    <p class="text"><b>Sawtooth</b></p>

    <p class="text">
        Generates a sawtooth wave. This channel has no duty functionalty but
        still uses that instrument setting to calculate the volume since the volume
        register is larger than 4 bits (0 - 15), one bit from the duty
        setting is used to form a 5-bit volume value. A volume level too high causes the wave to wrap around and
        will sound distorted (happens when duty = 1 and volume &gt; 5), so the useful volume range is usually 0 - 15
        anyway.</p>

    <p class="text">
        Instruments are specific for VRC6 but behaves much like those for 2A03, except
        that 8 duty levels are available and
        has no DPCM tab.</p>
