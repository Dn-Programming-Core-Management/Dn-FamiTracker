		<p class="text">
            NSF (Nintendo Sound Format, invented by Kevin Horton) is a type of file used to represent NES music,
            first developed for storing ripped game music. That means NSF is not a native 
            music format, instead it contains a small program that plays the music using the 
            NES&#39;s 6502 CPU. FamiTracker compresses and converts the module data
            and attaches a player program when creating the NSF file.
            </p>
        <p class="text">
            To create NSF files, select Create NSF from the File menu to open the NSF export window.
            The NSF file options contains some options related to the NSF file format: the 
            song information fields is the same as in the control panel. There is also a 
            system type option: NTSC, PAL or Dual. Select Dual if you want the NSF to be 
            playable on both types of system.</p>
        <p class="text">
            A few other formats beside NSF are also available:</p>

                Encapsulates the NSF into a NES file that can be played in emulators or with carts like PowerPak.

            As of version 0.3.5, an export plugin system has been added that 
            allows exporting to custom formats. New export targets will appear in the 
            drop-down menu when export plugin DLLs are added. More info about this is available on the web 
            page.</p>
